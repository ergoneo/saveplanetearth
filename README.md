# Project Title

Save Planet Earth (Final project for the Building AI course)

## Summary

Save Planet Earth is a tool that monitors the health of woods, forest and parks of our planet. This application is able to recognize the green zones and their characteristcs based on high resolution sattelite pictures. The aim of this project is to monitor the evolution of forests over time and to create awareness about 
the massive deforestations our planet is victim of.


## Background

Planet earth needs forests, woods and parks to prosper. Today planet earth is in danger due to human activities. Every years, big forests are cutted down. Their superficy decreases at a frightening speed.

But who has a clear global view of the health of the green zones of planet earth ? Some internatinal institutes may know, but at what extent. It's time to give awerness to everyone about the consequence of our behavior towards planet Earth.

This application will show to everyone the health states of each forests and highlight the zone where there is a deterioration over the last years. 

if thanks to this applications, more people are aware about the sitution and some of them take congrete action, it'd be considered as a success

In the future, we can also think about a advanved version for envirnonmental expert that will analyze more precisely the evolution of a forest over time.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
