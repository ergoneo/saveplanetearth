# Project Title

Save Planet Earth (Final project for the Building AI course)

## Summary

Save Planet Earth is a tool that monitors the health of woods, forest and parks of our planet. This application is able to recognize the green zones and their characteristcs based on high resolution sattelite pictures. The aim of this project is to monitor the evolution of forests over time and to create awareness about 
the massive deforestations our planet is victim of.


## Background

Planet earth needs forests, woods and parks to prosper. Today planet earth is in danger due to human activities. Every years, big forests are cutted down. Their superficy decreases at a frightening speed.

But who has a clear global view of the health of the green zones of planet earth ? Some internatinal institutes may know, but at what extent. It's time to give awerness to everyone about the consequence of our behavior towards planet Earth.

This application will show to everyone the health states of each forests and highlight the zone where there is a deterioration over the last years. 

if thanks to this applications, more people are aware about the sitution and some of them take congrete action, it'd be considered as a success

In the future, we can also think about a advanved version for envirnonmental expert that will analyze more precisely the evolution of a forest over time.

## How is it used?

Today the project contains only one file README.md. This section will be updated as soon as there is a beta version.


## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources we need for this project is a data base of high level resolution satellite pictues. Their are different satellite providers on the market. We need to do a market analysis to choose the most appropriate.

Also the database needs to be update regularly with up to date satelite pictures.

Machine learning is used to train the application to disscover forests, wood, park,... based on sattelite images.

Neural network will be used to assess the health of a forest by comparing with old data and data of other forests.



## Challenges

This project is ambitious. The bigg challenges are to find a good satellite picture provider and to have an good infrasture capable to treat tons of images in acceptable timeframe.

## What next?

In order to upgrade the application, we would need the insight of forest experts in order to better understand what is a forest it, and by consequences, to modelize the forest
